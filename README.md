Recurrent neural networks based language model.
 A single implementation file is used here which is named as capstone project.ipynb which primarily uses tensorflow framework. 
 This project basically creates new text depending on the kind of input text we train it on. 
 Instead of using reddit dataset for my project as i had mentioned previously, i have used a fiction novel's story as my dataset which is much smaller dataset thatn the reddit file.The model Can be trained for longer time and with lesser batch_size(32/64/128/256) to get better adaptable results.
