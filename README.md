Recurrent neural networks based language model.
 A single implementation file is used here which is named as capstone project.ipynb which primarily uses tensorflow framework. 
 This project basically creates new text depending on the kind of input text we train it on. 
 I have used the reddit comments dataset text file. Can be trained for longer time to get better adaptable results.
