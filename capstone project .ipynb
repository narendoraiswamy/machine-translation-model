    "### Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a Language Model using a Recurrent Neural Network. Let's say we have sentence of  n  words. Language Model allows us to predict the probability of observing the sentence (in a given dataset) as:\n",
    "P(w1,...,wn)=∏i=1nP(wi∣w1,...,wi−1)P(w1,...,wn)=∏i=1nP(wi∣w1,...,wi−1) \n",
    "In words, the probability of a sentence is the product of probabilities of each word given the words that came before it. So, the probability of the sentence \"He went to buy some chocolate\" would be the probability of \"chocolate\" given \"He went to buy some\", multiplied by the probability of \"some\" given \"He went to buy\", and so on.\n",
    "Why is that useful? Why would we want to assign a probability to observing a sentence?\n",
    "First, such a model can be used as a scoring mechanism. For example, a Machine Translation system typically generates multiple candidates for an input sentence. You could use a language model to pick the most probable sentence. Intuitively, the most probable sentence is likely to be grammatically correct. Similar scoring happens in speech recognition systems.\n",
    "But solving the Language Modeling problem also has a cool side effect. Because we can predict the probability of a word given the preceding words, we are able to generate new text. It's a generative model. Given an existing sequence of words we sample a next word from the predicted probabilities, and repeat the process until we have a full sentence.__ And this is exactly what we are  going to do i.e: Generate new text__"
